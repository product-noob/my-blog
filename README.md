my website based on minimal mistakes. 

The default branch is source where I enable the jekyll-scholar plugin. The master branch is for publishing gh-pages. 

My goal is to use gulp to automate the commit and deploy process for the website publishment. 


Sevel interesting changes I have made.  

* create a bibliography template (bibtemplate.html). It display the bibentries, the publishing status and doi.  The corresponding buttons can be customized 
using scss style file (_buttons.scss)
* the ieee citing style is modified. The index is removed. The title of the paper is hightlighted. The initialization of authors' name is
disabled.
